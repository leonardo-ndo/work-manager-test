# work-manager-test

Training the new task scheduler from Android.

Some highlights that called my personal attention, sorted:
- > "[...] tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts."
- > "[...] offers flexible retry policies, including a configurable exponential backoff policy."
- > "Declaratively define the optimal conditions for your work to run using Work Constraints. (For example, run only when the device is on Wi-Fi, when the device is idle, or when it has sufficient storage space, etc.)"
